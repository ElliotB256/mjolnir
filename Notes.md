# Additional Notes

There are some dependencies not currently included:

* matplotlib
* mpl_toolits

These are used in the test scripts for 3D plotting, but this
is not necessary for actual operation


## Saving images

This requires `pypng`.
I haven't implemented this yet.


## DLL Location

Failed to install python properly so I had some issues getting the DLL loaded.
This is the install location so I don't have to look for it again.

`C:\Program Files\Thorlabs\Scientific Imaging\uc480_64.dll`
